# Home Budget

After taking a long break from the industry, I am working hard to keep up with all of the latest web-development trends. I really enjoy React since it allows you to think more modularly when creating your app and also aids in encapsulation. I am practicing with React Router, which is another useful tool for making React's SPA behave more like a traditional website with discrete pages and routes. I went through one of the tutorials on Coding in Public. So, starting now, take charge of your spending, especially during the holiday season!
